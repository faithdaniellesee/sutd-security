# SUTD Security Track
## 50.020 Network Security Lab Assignments (Spring 2020)
Taught by Professor Jiang Wenchao.    
Assisted by Masters' student Vechalapu Himaja.  

Generally did quite well for these, got 59.5/60%, but still didn't do well for NetSec on a whole. :-(   

The weightages got increased so each lab was worth 6% but the updates were not done consistently.
