# SUTD Security Track
## 50.044 System Security Lab Assignments (Summer 2020)
Taught by Professor Dinh Tien Tuan Anh.  
Assisted by PhD student Garbelini Matheus Eduardo.  

I thought NetSec labs were tedious, SysSec tore me a new one. Thankfully we could work in pairs, so I teamed up with Ryan for this.
