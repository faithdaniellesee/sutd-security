An advantage of DHKE is that the secret key between the sender and receiver can be shared safely through an insecure channel even though the sender and receiver have no prior knowledge of each other.

However, this also leads to a disadvantage whereby the nature of DHKE makes it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks since it does not authenticate either party involved in the exchange. DHKE also cannot be used for asymmetric key exchange.
